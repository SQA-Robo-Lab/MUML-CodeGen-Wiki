# MUML Code Generation Wiki

There is quite a bit of code generation already possible with the [MechatronicUML](http://www.mechatronicuml.org/de/index.html), and some more stuff was added during a Master's thesis concluding May 2022 - however, barely any documentation exists. Therefore, this wiki was created.

As not all shortcomings of the past can be addressed, this wiki focues on
* Giving an overview about the code generion endeavors regarding the MUML (-> this page)
* Describing the newest additions: [Code Generation for Arduino using MQTT and I2C](arduino-code-gen/main.md)
* [User documentation: how to use the code generation?](user-documentation/main.md)
* [Developer documentation: how can the code generation be improved, extended, customized?](dev-documentation/main.md)
